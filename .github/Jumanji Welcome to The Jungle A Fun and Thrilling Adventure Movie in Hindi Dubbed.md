One of the main strengths of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is its self-awareness. The film knows that it is a sequel to a beloved classic, and it pays homage to it without trying to copy it. It also knows that it is a video game movie, and it makes fun of the tropes and cliches of the genre, such as the repetitive dialogue, the absurd plot, the generic villain and the convenient clues. The film does not take itself too seriously, and it invites the audience to join in on the fun.
 
Another strength of the film is its action and adventure. The film delivers some thrilling and creative set pieces, such as a helicopter chase, a rhino stampede, a snake attack and a bazaar brawl. The film also makes good use of its jungle setting, creating a colorful and vibrant world that is full of dangers and surprises. The film also has some heartwarming moments, as the characters learn to overcome their fears and insecurities, and form bonds with each other.
 
However, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is not without its flaws. The film suffers from some pacing issues, especially in the second act, where it drags a bit and loses some of its momentum. The film also relies too much on some jokes that get old quickly, such as Kevin Hart's height or Karen Gillan's skimpy outfit. The film also wastes some of its supporting characters, such as Bobby Cannavale's villain or Nick Jonas' ally, who are underdeveloped and forgettable.
 
Overall, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a fun and entertaining sequel that manages to update the original concept for a new generation. It has a talented and charismatic cast, a witty and clever script, and some exciting and hilarious action scenes. It may not be as memorable or magical as the first film, but it is still a worthy addition to the Jumanji franchise.

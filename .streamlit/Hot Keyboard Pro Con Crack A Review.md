## Drawbacks of Hot Keyboard Pro
 
Hot Keyboard Pro is not a perfect software. It has some drawbacks that you should be aware of before buying it. Some of the drawbacks are:

- It is not free. It costs $29.95 for a single-user license and $99.95 for a site license. You can download a 21-day trial version to test it out, but you will need to purchase a license to use it after that.
- It may not work with some applications or websites that have their own keyboard shortcuts or security measures.
- It may conflict with other keyboard-related software or hardware that you have installed on your computer.
- It may require some technical knowledge and skills to create complex scripts or macros.

## Dangers of Using a Con Crack
 
A con crack is a modified version of a software that bypasses its license verification or activation process. It may seem tempting to use a con crack to get Hot Keyboard Pro for free, but it is not worth the risk. Some of the dangers of using a con crack are:

- It may contain malware or viruses that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
- It may not work properly or have limited functionality compared to the original version.
- It may cause compatibility issues or errors with other software or hardware on your computer.
- It may violate the terms and conditions of the software developer and expose you to legal consequences.

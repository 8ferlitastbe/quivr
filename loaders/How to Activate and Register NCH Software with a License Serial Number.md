2. Purchase a license using your credit card from the [NCH Software order page](https://secure.nch.com.au/cgi-bin/register.exe?software=all). If you only purchased one software product, you will be supplied with a registration code on the screen and by email. Proceed to Step 4. If you purchased multiple software products, you will be supplied with a 13-digit serial number on the screen and by email. This is your license serial number. Continue to Step 3.
3. Activate your license by entering your serial number and registration information into the activation form at: [https://secure.nch.com.au/activate](https://secure.nch.com.au/activate). This will generate the registration code for your software.
4. Enter the registration code by starting the program, going to the File menu, choosing Register Software, pasting your registration code into the dialog box and clicking Register. This process will convert the demo version of the software to a professional version. If you do not receive an error message, the details have been accepted.
